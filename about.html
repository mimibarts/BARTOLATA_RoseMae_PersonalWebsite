<p></p><br>
<p>I'm Rose Mae Bartolata. My nickname is Mae, so you can call me Mimi/Mae. I'm from Sto. Niño Pelayo Barangay Centro Agdao, Davao City. I was born on 4th day of March 1997, so I am 20 years old now. We are 4 members in the family with my twin sis and my parents. I am graduated in High School in Holy Cross of Agdao, and now I am in my first semester of junior year in Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at University of Southeastern Philippines. I'm the type of person who stays, even if others are not like taking to this course, I have no choice, but to pursue, to conquer, to continue fighting. I know this course is not easy but yeah I'm trying, I'm working on it and I want to prove to myself and to others, that I can make it. (I hope so T_T) </p><br />

<p>Anyways, I will describe my personality first. I have three sides: the quiet side. Sir I'm a shy type student. Sometimes I don’t matter how many people are around me, if I feel I don't belong  to this group I've rather to be alone. But sometimes I do the stupidest things when I get comfortable with someone, and that's the Second side of me, the happy and crazy side. I always make others happy even if I'm not. I just like to make them happy. I don't want to see them sad especially when it comes to my family and friends. Lastly, the side you never want to see. I know you think that I have a worst side when getting mad but no. I don't make scene. I don't use any kind of deadly weapons to hurt others. I'm just sit and I don't want to talked to anyone else. All I want is to be alone. I'm a sensitive type of person. I'm getting hurt easily. I love to watch the sky, I do like being alone with someone talking and watching the stars. I love the smell of the rain and gasoline. (HAHA weird)  I guess, too much for this. Sorry po hihi. Again I'm a brave girl, and strong, and broken. All at once.</p>
